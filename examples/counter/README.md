# Counter Example

A simple example showing different ways to use the `@select` decorator and
the action creator service pattern.

## Running this Example

There are two ways to run this example:

1. `npm start`: this will run the example against the published npm version of
ng2-redux on port 8080. Use this if you just want to play around with the
example.
2. `npm run dev`: exactly the same as (1) except we link to the local ng2-redux
source code in `../../`. Use this if you want to test modifications to ng2-redux
itself.
