## Installation

```sh
npm install --save ng2-redux
```

## Quick Start

### Initialization

Import the `NgRedux` class and add it to your application as an Angular 2
provider.

```typescript
import {bootstrap} from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { App } from './containers/App';

bootstrap(App, [ NgRedux ]);
```

Once you've done this, you'll be able to inject 'NgRedux' into your
Angular 2 components. In your top-level app component, you
can configure your Redux store with reducers, initial state,
and optionally middlewares and enhancers as you would in Redux directly.

```typescript
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
const thunk = require('redux-thunk').default;
import { rootReducer } from './reducers';

interface IAppState {
  // ...   
};
@Component({
  // ... etc.
})
class App {
  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {
    this.ngRedux.configureSture(rootReducer, {}, [ thunk ]);
  }

  // ...
}
```

Now your Angular 2 app has been reduxified!

## Usage

`ng2-redux` has three main usage patterns: `the decorator interface`, the `select` pattern and the `connect` pattern.

### The Decorator Interface

This is the simplest and cleanest approach. It attempts to reduce boiler plate code, separates Redux concerns allowing the class's code to focus on it's business concerns and smoothens the learning curve. It also enables more modular components to be created with minimum effort, some of which can be seen in the examples below.

The decorator interface currently consists of 3 decorators: 
- `@dispatch` ( configures new methods on the class to dispatch Redux actions )
- `@select` ( selects store slices and makes them available as properties on the class )
- `@dispatchAll` ( just like `@dispatch`, but in batches )

> Note: all decorators rely on NgRedux to be injected and configured in the angular app's Root Component. Aside from that, the decorators fully encapsulate the Redux connectivity and the NgRedux injectable doesn't need to be injected in any other class that needs to use the decorators, removing the need to implement a constructor and call functions within the component's lifecycle only for the purpose of NgRedux.

#### The @dispatch decorator

The `@dispatch` decorator can be added to the property of any angular component/injectable class to allow it to dispatch an action creator.
It will decorate a property of a class, replacing it with a function that will dispatch the action creator it receives as a parameter. 

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular2/core';
import { dispatch } from 'ng2-redux';

// import the action creator function
import { increment } from '../actions/CounterActions';

@Component({
    selector: 'increment-button',
    template: `
    <button (click)="increment()"></button>
    `
 })
 export class IncrementButton {
    // decorate a function on the class called increment
    // which will dispatch the increment action creator 
    //   imported from '../actions/CounterActions'
    @dispatch(increment) increment;
 }

```

#### The @select decorator

The `@select` decorator can be added to the property of any class or angular component/injectable.
It will decorate the property into an observable which observes the Redux Store Value which is selected by the decorator's parameter.
The decorator expects to receive a `string`, a `function` or no parameter at all. 

- If a `string` is passed the `@select` decorator will attempt to observe a store property whose name matches the value represented by the `string`.
- If a `function` is passed the `@select` decorator will attempt to use that function as a selector on the RxJs observable. 
- If nothing is passed then the `@select` decorator will attempt to use the name of the class property to find a matching value in the Redux store. Note that a utility is in place here where any $ characters will be ignored from the class property's name.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular2/core';
import { AsyncPipe } from '@angular2/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
import { select } from 'ng2-redux';

@Component({
    pipes: [AsyncPipe],
    selector: 'counter-value-printed-many-times',
    template: `
    <p>{counter$ | async}</p>
    <p>{counter | async}</p>
    <p>{counterSelectedWithString | async}</p>
    <p>{counterSelectedWithFunction | async}</p>
    <p>{counterSelectedWithFunctionAndMultipliedByTwo | async}</p>
    `
})
export class CounterValue {

    // this selects `counter` from the store and attaches it to this property
    // it uses the property name to select, and ignores the $ from it
    @select() counter$;

    // this selects `counter` from the store and attaches it to this property
    @select() counter;

    // this selects `counter` from the store and attaches it to this property
    @select('counter') counterSelectedWithString;

    // this selects `counter` from the store and attaches it to this property
    @select(state => state.counter) counterSelectedWithFunction;

    // this selects `counter` from the store and multiples it by two
    @select(state => state.counter * 2) 
    counterSelectedWithFuntionAndMultipliedByTwo: Observable<any>;

}
```

#### The @dispatchAll decorator

A class decorator that does the exact same thing that the old `ngRedux.mapDispatchToThis` used to do.
The benefit of using this decorator is that it reduces code even further ( and quite significantly, the more actions need to be added ).
A potential caveat however could be that this decorator magically attaches functions to your class without making it very obvious in the code. Some teams could find this confusing. In that case the `@dispatch` decorator offers the perfect alternative.


```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular2/core';
import { dispatchAll } from 'ng2-redux';

// assuming that this module file exports 4 action creator functions called:
// increment, decrement, incrementIfOdd, incrementAsync
import * as CounterActions from '../actions/CounterActions';

@Component({
    selector: 'counter-menu',
    template: `
    <button (click)="increment()">+</button>
    <button (click)="decrement()">-</button>
    <button (click)="incrementIfOdd()">Increment if odd</button>
    <button (click)="incrementAsync()">Increment async</button>
    `
})
@dispatchAll(CounterActions)
export class CounterMenu {}
```

> Note: Since the `@dispatchAll` decorates the class with new methods which are never declared as properties of the class, the methods will only be available within the template. In order to call the methods from the class's code, their names can be predefined in the class, otherwise typescript won't know they exist, and will not compile.

#### The decorator interface: putting it all together

The decorator interface allows classes to focus on what they represent. Through this simplification it makes it easier to design better encapsulated components which can aggregate their behaviour and data internally, from multiple reducers and store slices, without complicating the code.

In the example below we can see a fully encapsulated `counter` component, which doesn't require a smart component to pass it's data, aggregates behaviour from multiple reducers using the `@dispatch` decorator to easily attach action creators imported from anywhere, and showcases some internal logic combining multiple values selected from the store using the versatile `@select` decorator.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular2/core';
import { dispatch, 
         dispatchAll,
         select } from 'ng2-redux';
import { AsyncPipe } from '@angular2/common';
import * as CounterActions from '../actions/CounterActions';
import { logout } from '../actions/UserSessionActions';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/combineLatest';

@Component({
    pipes: [AsyncPipe],
    selector: 'counter',
    template: `
    <p>Clicked: {{ counter | async }} times</p>
    <p>Value from combined observables: {{ doublePlusCounter | async }}</p>
    <button (click)="increment()">+</button>
    <button (click)="decrement()">-</button>
    <button (click)="incrementIfOdd()">Increment if odd</button>
    <button (click)="incrementAsync()">Increment async</button></p>
    <button (click)="actionFromAnotherReducer()">Logout</button></p>
    `
})
@dispatchAll(CounterActions)
export class Counter {

    @select() counter;
    @select(state => state.counter * state.counter) counterDouble;

    doublePlusCounter: any;

    @dispatch(logout) actionFromAnotherReducer;
		
    ngOnInit() {
        this.counter
            .combineLatest(this.counterDouble, 
                (latestCounter, latestCounterDouble) => {
                    return latestCounter + latestCounterDouble;
             })
            .subscribe(n => {
                this.doublePlusCounter = n;
            });
    }
}
```



### The Select Pattern

This is a good approach for those that don't want to use decorators yet still want to use Observables to interface
more cleanly with common Angular 2 usage patterns.

In this approach, we use `ngRedux.select()` to get observables from slices of our store
state:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular2/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { AsyncPipe } from '@angular2/common';
import { Counter } from '../components/Counter';
import * as CounterActions from '../actions/CounterActions';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';

interface IAppState {
  counter: number;
};

@Component({
    selector: 'root',
    directives: [Counter],
    pipes: [AsyncPipe],
    template: `
  <counter [counter]="counter$| async"
    [increment]="increment"
    [decrement]="decrement">
  </counter>
  `
})
export class Counter {
  private count$: Observable<number>;

  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux<IAppState>) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    let {increment, decrement } = CounterActions;
    this.counter$ = this.ngRedux.select('counter');
  }

  incrementIfOdd = () => this.ngRedux.dispatch(
    <any>CounterActions.incrementIfOdd());

  incrementAsync = () => this.ngRedux.dispatch(
    <any>CounterActions.incrementAsync());
}
```

`ngRedux.select` can take a property name or a function which transforms a property.
Since it's an observable, you can also transform data using observable operators like
`.map`, `.filter`, etc.

### The Connect Pattern

Alternately you can use the 'ngRedux.connect' API, which will map your state and action creators
to the component class directly.

This pattern is provided for backwards compatibility. It's worth noting that
Angular 2's view layer is more optimized for Observables and the `select`
pattern above.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Counter } from '../components/Counter';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';

export interface IAppState {
  counter: number;
};

// NB: 'import * as CounterActions' won't provide the right type
// for bindActionCreators.
const CounterActions = require('../actions/CounterActions');

@Component({
    selector: 'root',
    directives: [Counter],
    template: `
  <counter [counter]="counter"
    [increment]="actions.increment"
    [decrement]="actions.decrement">
  </counter>
  `
})
export class Counter {
  private count$: Observable<number>;

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.disconnect();
  }

  // Will result in this.counter being set to the store value of counter
  // after each change.
  mapStateToTarget(state) {
    return { counter: state.counter };
  }

  // Will result in a method being created on the component for each
  // action creator, which dispatches to the store when called.
  mapDispatchToThis(dispatch) {
    return { actions: bindActionCreators(CounterActions, dispatch) };
  }
}
```

## Cookbooks

### Using Angular 2 Services in your Action Creators

In order to use services in action creators, we need to integrate
them into Angular 2's dependency injector.

We may as well adopt a more class-based approach to satisfy
Angular 2's OOP idiom, and to allow us to

1. make our actions `@Injectable()`, and
2. inject other services for our action creators to use.

Take a look at this example, which injects NgRedux to access
`dispatch` and `getState` (a replacement for `redux-thunk`),
and a simple `RandomNumberService` to show a side effect.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { NgRedux } from 'ng2-redux';
import * as Redux from 'redux';
import { RootState } from '../store';
import { RandomNumberService } from '../services/random-number';

@Injectable()
export class CounterActions {
  constructor (
    private ngRedux: NgRedux<RootState>,
    private randomNumberService: RandomNumberService) {}

  static INCREMENT_COUNTER: string = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER';
  static DECREMENT_COUNTER: string = 'DECREMENT_COUNTER';
  static RANDOMIZE_COUNTER: string = 'RANDOMIZE_COUNTER';

  // Basic action
  increment(): void {
    this.ngRedux.dispatch({ type: CounterActions.INCREMENT_COUNTER });
  }

  // Basic action
  decrement(): void {
    this.ngRedux.dispatch({ type: CounterActions.DECREMENT_COUNTER });
  }

  // Async action.
  incrementAsync(delay: number = 1000): void {
    setTimeout(this.increment.bind(this), delay);
  }

  // State-dependent action
  incrementIfOdd(): void {
    const { counter } = this.ngRedux.getState();
    if (counter % 2 !== 0) {
      this.increment();
    }
  }

  // Service-dependent action
  randomize(): void {
    this.ngRedux.dispatch({
      type: CounterActions.RANDOMIZE_COUNTER,
      payload: this.randomNumberService.pick()
    });
  }
}
```

To use these action creators, we can just go ahead and inject
them into our component:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NgRedux, select } from 'ng2-redux';
import { CounterActions } from '../actions/counter-actions';
import { RandomNumberService } from '../services/random-number';

@Component({
  selector: 'counter',
  providers: [ CounterActions, RandomNumberService ],
  template: `
  <p>
    Clicked: {{ counter$ | async }} times
    <button (click)="actions.increment()">+</button>
    <button (click)="actions.decrement()">-</button>
    <button (click)="actions.incrementIfOdd()">Increment if odd</button>
    <button (click)="actions.incrementAsync(2222)">Increment async</button>
    <button (click)="actions.randomize()">Set to random number</button>
  </p>
  `
})
export class Counter {
  @select('counter') counter$: any;

  constructor(private actions: CounterActions) {}
}
```

### Using Angular 2 Services in your Middleware

Again, we just want to use Angular DI the way it was meant to be used.

Here's a contrived example that fetches a name from a remote API using Angular's
`Http` service:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Http } from '@angular/http';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';

@Injectable()
export class LogRemoteName {
  constructor(private http: Http) {}

  middleware = store => next => action => {
    console.log('getting user name');
    this.http.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
      .toPromise()
      .then(response => {
        console.log('got name:', response.json().name);
        return next(action);
      })
      .catch(err => console.log('get name failed:', err));
    }
}
```

As with the action example above, we've attached our middleware function to
an `@Injectable` class that can itself receive services from Angular's dependency
injector.

Note the arrow function called `middleware`: this is what we can pass to the middlewares
parameter when we initialize ngRedux in our top-level component. We use an arrow function
to make sure that what we pass to ngRedux has a properly-bound function context.

```typescript
import { LogRemoteName } from './middleware/log-remote-name';
const thunk = require('redux-thunk').default;
const reduxLogger = require('redux-logger');

@Component({
  providers: [ LogRemoteName ],
  // ...
})
class App {
  constructor(
    private ngRedux: NgRedux
    logRemoteName: LogRemoteName) {

    const middleware = [ thunk, reduxLogger(), logRemoteName.middleware ];
    this.ngRedux.configureStore(
      rootReducer,
      initialState,
      middleware);
  }
}
```

### Using DevTools

Ng2Redux is fully compatible with the Chrome extension version of the Redux dev tools:

https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

Here's how to enable them in your app (you probably only want to do
this in development mode):

```typescript
const enhancers = [];

// Add Whatever other enhancers you want.

if (__DEVMODE__ && window.devToolsExtension) {
  enhancers = [ ...enhancers, window.devToolsExtension() ];
}

// Add the dev tools enhancer your ngRedux.configureStore called
// when you initialize your root component:
@Component({
  // ...
})
class App {
  constructor(private ngRedux: NgRedux) {
    this.ngRedux.configureStore(rootReducer, initialState, [], enhancers);
  }
}
```

## API

### `configureStore()`

Initializes your ngRedux store. This should be called once, typically in your
top-level app component's constructor.

__Arguments:__

* `rootReducer` \(*Reducer*): Your top-level Redux reducer.
* `initialState` \(*Object): The desired initial state of your store.
* `middleware` \(*Middleware[]*): An optional array of Redux middleware functions.
* `enhancers` \(*StoreEnhancer[StoreEnhancer]*): An optional array of Redux store enhancer functions.

### select(key | function,[comparer]) => Observable

Exposes a slice of state as an observable. Accepts either a property name or a selector function.

If using the async pipe, you do not need to subscribe to it explicitly, but can use the angular
Async pipe to bind its values into your template.

__Arguments:__

* `key` \(*string*): A key within the state that you want to subscribe to. 
* `selector` \(*Function*): A function that accepts the application state, and returns the slice you want subscribe to for changes. 

e.g:
```typescript
this.counter$ = this.ngRedux.select(state=>state.counter);
// or 
this.counterSubscription = this.ngRedux
  .select(state=>state.counter)
  .subscribe(count=>this.counter = count);
// or

this.counter$ = this.ngRedux.select('counter');  
```

### @select(key | function)

Property decorator.

Attaches an observable to the property which will reflect the latest value in the Redux store.

__Arguments:__

* `key` \(*string*): A key within the state that you want to subscribe to.
* `selector` \(*Function*): A function that accepts the application state, and returns the slice you want to subscribe to for changes.

e.g. see [the @select decorator](#the-select-decorator)

### @dispatch(func)

Property decorator.

Attaches a class instance method which will dispatch the action creator passed as the function.

__Arguments:__

* `func` \(*Function*): A redux action creator function

e.g. see [the @dispatch decorator](#the-dispatch-decorator)

### @dispatchAll(obj)

Class decorator.

Attaches class instance methods to the class which will dispatch every action creator function found on the received object. 

__Arguments:__

* `obj` \(*Object*): An object containing Action Creator functions. Anything else other than a function will be ignored. 

That is if: 

```typescript
@dispatchAll({
    increment: () => (<Redux.Action>{ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
    decrement: () => (<Redux.Action>{ type: 'DECREMENT' })
})
class Counter {}
```

then the counter component will have two methods: `this.increment` and `this.decrement` which will dispatch the action creators from the received object.

e.g. see [the @dispatchAll decorator](#the-dispatchall-decorator)

### `connect(mapStateToTarget, mapDispatchToTarget)(target)`

Connects an Angular component to Redux, and maps action creators and store
properties onto the component instance.

__Arguments:__
* `mapStateToTarget` \(*Function*): connect will subscribe to Redux store updates. Any time it updates, mapStateToTarget will be called. Its result must be a plain object, and it will be merged into `target`. If you have a component which simply triggers actions without needing any state you can pass null to `mapStateToTarget`.
* [`mapDispatchToTarget`] \(*Object* or *Function*): Optional. If an object is passed, each function inside it will be assumed to be a Redux action creator. An object with the same function names, but bound to a Redux store, will be merged onto `target`. If a function is passed, it will be given `dispatch`. It’s up to you to return an object that somehow uses `dispatch` to bind action creators in your own way. (Tip: you may use the [`bindActionCreators()`](http://gaearon.github.io/redux/docs/api/bindActionCreators.html) helper from Redux.).

*You then need to invoke the function a second time, with `target` as parameter:*
* `target` \(*Object* or *Function*): If passed an object, the results of `mapStateToTarget` and `mapDispatchToTarget` will be merged onto it. If passed a function, the function will receive the results of `mapStateToTarget` and `mapDispatchToTarget` as parameters.

e.g:
```typescript
connect(this.mapStateToThis, this.mapDispatchToThis)(this);
//Or
connect(this.mapState, this.mapDispatch)((selectedState, actions) => {/* ... */});
```

__Remarks:__
* The `mapStateToTarget` function takes a single argument of the entire Redux store’s state and returns an object to be passed as props. It is often called a selector. Use reselect to efficiently compose selectors and compute derived data.

### Store API
All of redux's store methods (i.e. `dispatch`, `subscribe` and `getState`) are exposed by $ngRedux and can be accessed directly. For example:

```typescript
ngRedux.subscribe(() => {
    let state = $ngRedux.getState();
    //...
})
```

This means that you are free to use Redux basic API in advanced cases where `connect`'s API would not fill your needs.
